# Ephemerist

Ephemerist is an innovative, ephemeral peer-to-peer (P2P) chat application that leverages unique fractal images to establish secure chat sessions. This project combines the beauty of fractals with the need for secure, transient communication, offering an intuitive and confidential messaging platform.

## Features

- **Fractal-Based Session Initialization**: Unique fractal images are used for initiating each chat session, providing both security and a visually engaging experience.
- **Ephemeral Messaging**: Messages and session data are securely erased after the session ends, leaving no trace behind.
- **Peer-to-Peer Connectivity**: Enables direct, serverless communication between users, enhancing privacy and control.
- **Simplicity and Accessibility**: Designed for ease of use, requiring minimal setup and technical knowledge.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install Ephemerist using pip with the following command:

```bash
pip install ephemerist
```

## Usage

Start a chat session by executing the command below:

```bash
ephemerist
```

This will generate a unique fractal image. Share this image securely with your intended chat partner. Once they input this image into their instance of Ephemerist, a secure chat session will be established.
